r"""Find the full path to commands.

which(command, path=None, verbose=0, exts=None)
    Return the full path to the first match of the given command on the
    path.

whichall(command, path=None, verbose=0, exts=None)
    Return a list of full paths to all matches of the given command on
    the path.

whichgen(command, path=None, verbose=0, exts=None)
    Return a generator which will yield full paths to all matches of the
    given command on the path.

By default the PATH environment variable is searched (as well as, on
Windows, the AppPaths key in the registry), but a specific 'path' list
to search may be specified as well.  On Windows, the PATHEXT environment
variable is applied as appropriate.

If "verbose" is true then a tuple of the form
    (<fullpath>, <matched-where-description>)
is returned for each match. The latter element is a textual description
of where the match was found. For example:
    from PATH element 0
    from HKLM\SOFTWARE\...\perl.exe
"""

_cmdlnUsage = """
    Show the full path of commands.

    Usage:
        which [<options>...] [<command-name>...]
